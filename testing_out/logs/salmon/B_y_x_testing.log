[2018-06-21 10:50:26.018] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as ISF
[2018-06-21 10:50:26.303] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 29.24% zero probability fragments








[2018-06-21 10:50:26.330] [jointLog] [info] Computed 132 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-21 10:50:26.330] [jointLog] [info] Counted 49190 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-21 10:50:26.332] [jointLog] [warning] Only 49190 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
